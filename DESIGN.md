## Overview

Cohere's current web presence feels like a sober enterprise AI command center with editorial restraint. The home page opens on a huge typographic declaration over a white canvas, then uses photography, dark product mockups, trust logos, and generous empty space to make AI infrastructure feel controlled rather than speculative. Product pages invert the tone into deep green-black or dark navy bands, while blog and research pages move toward publishing-system clarity: large filters, thin rules, dense lists, and pale technical backgrounds.

What makes the system distinctive is the mix of austere black-and-white UI with bursts of tactile brand imagery. The site avoids decorative chrome in the normal interface; color arrives through photography, abstract 3D media, coral blog taxonomy chips, blue research links, and dark product environments. Cards are rounded but not cute. Type is large, tight, and almost monospaced in spirit, creating a research-lab cadence across marketing, product, and editorial surfaces.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Monumental display headlines with very tight line height and negative tracking.
- White editorial canvases interrupted by deep green, dark navy, and image-led CTA bands.
- Rounded media cards and product cards, usually 8px to 22px.
- Pill CTAs in near-black or white, with most secondary actions rendered as underlined text links.
- Trust-logo strips with monochrome partner marks and very wide vertical spacing.
- Agent-console mockups using dark panels, small status chips, and product integration badges.
- Blog and research surfaces with prominent taxonomy chips, long rule-separated lists, and search fields.

## Colors

### Brand & Accent

- **Cohere Black** (`#000000`): Announcement bar, highest-contrast text, and the global brand anchor.
- **Near-Black Primary** (`#17171c`): Primary CTA buttons, dark footer, and deep UI cards.
- **Deep Enterprise Green** (`#003c33`): Product hero bands for North and Command-style dark sections.
- **Dark Navy** (`#071829`): Financial-services and security-oriented solution bands.
- **Action Blue** (`#1863dc`): Editorial links, pagination, and secondary action emphasis.
- **Coral** (`#ff7759`): Blog category chips, taxonomy outlines, and warm product markers.
- **Soft Coral** (`#ffad9b`): Pale chip borders and segmented article-label details.

### Surface & Background

- **Canvas White** (`#ffffff`): Dominant page background and form/card surface.
- **Soft Stone** (`#eeece7`): Product cards, testimonial placeholders, and warm neutral surface blocks.
- **Pale Green Wash** (`#edfce9`): North page section backdrop behind stacked dark capability panels.
- **Pale Blue Wash** (`#f1f5ff`): Blog CTA surface behind abstract 3D imagery.
- **Card Border** (`#f2f2f2`): Softest card containment line.

### Text & Rules

- **Ink** (`#212121`): Default body text and most link text on light backgrounds.
- **Muted Slate** (`#68687a`): Footer links, dates, metadata, and de-emphasized labels. Darkened from Cohere's `#93939f`, which measured 3.0:1 on white and failed WCAG AA at the body sizes this site uses it for. The current value clears 4.5:1 on both `--canvas` and `--stone`.
- **Slate** (`#5f5f70`): Tertiary text, card body copy, and separators. Darkened from `#75758a` for the same reason.
- **Hairline** (`#d9d9dd`): Standard list rules and section dividers.
- **Border Light** (`#e5e7eb`): Secondary divider and utility rule.

### Semantic

- **Focus Blue** (`#4c6ee6`): Keyboard focus and ring color.
- **Form Focus Violet** (`#9b60aa`): Focus border for text inputs.
- **Error Red** (`#b30000`): Extracted ring/shadow color associated with validation-like states.

### Gradient System

Cohere does not use gradients as a generic UI fill. Gradients and color fields are media-led: abstract 3D hero imagery, deep blue open-science particle fields, red-orange product video posters, and dark green-to-black product environments. Keep UI surfaces flat; reserve gradient richness for large media panels and CTA image bands.

## Typography

### Font Family

**Helvetica only.** The portfolio implementation uses a single family for every
role — display, body, and label:

```css
--font-sans: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
```

`--font-display`, `--font-body`, and `--font-label` all alias `--font-sans`.
There is no webfont request: the stack resolves locally on every target
platform, with Arial as the Windows fallback.

This is a deliberate divergence from Cohere's three-family system (CohereText /
Unica77 / CohereMono). Because there is no second family and no mono face,
hierarchy has to be carried entirely by **size, weight, tracking, and colour**.

### Hierarchy

All rows use Helvetica. `--track-label` is `0.08em`.

| Role | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Hero Display | clamp(2.05rem → 3.4rem) | 500 | 0.96 | -0.04em | Name. Tight and carved. |
| Section Heading | clamp(1.6rem → 2.1rem) | 500 | 1.05 | -0.035em | `section h2`. |
| Card Heading | 16–19px | 600 | 1.25 | -0.025em | Project names, roles, award titles. |
| Publication Title | clamp(16px → 18px) | 500 / 600 linked | 1.30 | -0.02em | 600 when the title is a link. |
| Stat Number | clamp(26px → 32px) | 500 | 1.00 | -0.04em | `tabular-nums`. |
| Body Large | clamp(16px → 18px) | 400 | 1.50 | -0.005em | About lead. |
| Body | 15px | 400 | 1.55 | 0 | Default copy. |
| Body Small | 13.5–14px | 400 | 1.50 | 0 | Card and bullet copy. |
| Button | 14px | 500 | 1.50 | 0 | Pill CTA labels. |
| Label (was Mono) | 11px | 500–600 | 1.35 | 0.08em | Uppercase. Eyebrows, stat labels, periods, tags. |
| Micro | 12px | 400 | 1.40 | 0 | Footer copy, venue lines. |

### Principles

- One family. Never introduce a second typeface, including for "technical" or
  code-like labels.
- Helvetica goes soft at mid sizes, so titles sit at **500–600**, not 400. Large
  display type stays at 500 and leans on negative tracking instead of weight.
- Uppercase + `0.08em` tracking is the label voice that replaces the mono face.
  Uppercase Helvetica without added tracking reads cramped — the tracking is
  load-bearing, not decorative.
- Set numerals with `tabular-nums` wherever they align in a column (stats,
  dates, venue years).
- Keep display type tight; hero copy should feel compact, not airy.

## Layout

### Spacing System

The system uses an 8px base with many one-off alignment values: `2px`, `6px`, `8px`, `10px`, `12px`, `16px`, `20px`, `22px`, `24px`, `28px`, `32px`, `36px`, `40px`, `56px`, `60px`, `64px`, and `80px`.

Large sections rely on dramatic vertical breathing room. The home page places a trust-logo strip far below the hero media. Product pages often hold dark panels inside fields of empty white space, then transition to dense forms or footers only near the end.

### Grid & Container

- Global nav uses a three-zone layout: logo left, menu centered, sign-in/CTA right.
- Home hero is centered text above a two-card media composition: a wide product mockup card beside a narrower photography card.
- Feature sections commonly use 3-column cards on desktop.
- Product pages alternate centered hero blocks, trust-logo strips, large single-feature bands, and 2- or 3-column card grids.
- Research pages use full-width lists with date and chip columns instead of decorative cards.
- Forms use two-column input rows inside a rounded white card on dark or stone section backgrounds.

### Whitespace Philosophy

Cohere uses whitespace as a trust signal. Large empty intervals separate the brand claim, customer proof, product proof, and CTA. Dense content appears only where it serves the information architecture: research paper rows, blog card grids, and contact form fields.

## Elevation & Depth

Cohere is mostly flat. Depth comes from surface alternation, media contrast, rounded corners, and thin borders rather than drop shadows.

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Flat | No shadow, white or dark field | Hero copy, research lists, editorial surfaces |
| Bordered | 1px `#d9d9dd`, `#e5e7eb`, or dark translucent rules | Research rows, forms, pale cards, footer inputs |
| Media Lift | Rounded image or video over contrasting section color | Hero photo cards, product videos, CTA imagery |
| Dark Product Field | Deep green or navy full-width band | Command, North, financial services, security sections |

## Shapes

### Radius Scale

Four steps plus a pill. Fewer values than the source system, applied
consistently — every pill-shaped control uses the same token rather than a
spread of 30px/32px one-offs.

| Token | Value | Role |
|---|---:|---|
| `--radius-xs` | 4px | Skip link, focus outlines, utility elements |
| `--radius-sm` | 8px | Social icon buttons, nav items, small media |
| `--radius-md` | 12px | Stat cards, experience items, award cards, edu panel |
| `--radius-lg` | 20px | Project cards, cert cards, profile photo frame |
| `--radius-pill` | 999px | All pill controls: buttons, chips, badges, tags |

### Image Treatment

Images are not decorative backdrops for text except in CTA bands. Most imagery sits as rounded cards with visible corners: product videos, enterprise photography, article thumbnails, and abstract 3D renders. The dominant radii are 8px and 22px.

## Components

### **`button-primary`**

Near-black or white pill CTA, depending on surface contrast. Uses 14px-16px Unica77, 12px 24px padding, and a 32px pill radius. This is the primary action style for "Request a demo", "Submit", and hero CTAs.

### **`button-secondary`**

Text-only action link, usually underlined or rule-aligned, with no filled background. Used for "Explore products", "Try the Playground", newsletter signup, and secondary hero actions.

### **`button-pill-outline`**

Outlined pill control with transparent fill, 1px dark border, and 30px radius. Used for research filters, topic tags, and lightweight taxonomy controls.

### **`announcement-bar`**

Full-width black strip above the nav, 36px tall, centered microcopy with an underlined "Learn more" link and a close control at the far right.

### **`hero-photo-card`**

Rounded media card used in the home hero and solution pages. It combines photography or abstract imagery with an overlaid dark agent-console module. Radius is usually 22px on large cards and 8px on smaller thumbnails.

### **`agent-console-card`**

Dark product mockup panel showing agent names, status chips, integration badges, prompt fields, and generated response cards. Background is near-black, text is white or muted, and small accent chips use product colors.

### **`trust-logo-strip`**

Centered copy above a row of monochrome customer logos. It is intentionally quiet: no cards, no borders, just large horizontal spacing and black or white logos depending on the background.

### **`capability-card`**

Content block with thin-line geometric illustration, 24px heading, body copy, and a text link. On light backgrounds, cards often have only a top rule or a subtle image/card relationship rather than full boxing.

### **`dark-feature-band`**

Deep green or navy full-width section used for product capabilities, security claims, and feature breakdowns. Text turns white; cards use darker translucent surfaces, pale borders, and abstract line illustrations.

### **`product-card`**

Warm stone card used for product/model summaries. Typically 3-column on desktop, with 8px radius, generous padding, a small pill button, a divider line, and checkmark bullet rows.

### **`blog-filter-chip`**

Large coral taxonomy chip used on the blog index. Active chips invert to coral fill with dark text; inactive chips use coral outline and pale fill. Typography is oversized relative to typical filters, making the taxonomy a hero-level control.

### **`research-table`**

Rule-separated publication list with title left, topic pills centered, and date right. Rows are tall, white, and border-driven; filters above use many compact outlined pills.

### **`contact-form-card`**

Rounded white form panel set against dark green or warm stone sections. Inputs are rectangular with thin gray borders, 12px-16px padding, and compact labels/placeholders. Submit uses the same near-black pill style as primary CTAs.

### **`footer-newsletter`**

Dark footer subscription block with coral "AI moves fast" label, white headline, muted legal microcopy, a single-line email field, and arrow submit marker. Footer columns use white section labels and muted links.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- Use white canvas as the default surface; introduce dark green or navy as full-width product bands.
- Keep primary CTAs pill-shaped and near-black on light surfaces.
- Use 22px radius on major media cards and placeholders.
- Use coral for editorial taxonomy and small warm accents, not as the main CTA system.
- Use monochrome trust logos with wide spacing.
- Use thin-line geometric illustrations for research and capability icons.
- Let photography and product mockups carry color, while the UI shell stays restrained.

### Don't

- Do not turn coral or blue into broad decorative surface colors.
- Do not add heavy drop shadows to cards.
- Do not make every section card-based; Cohere often uses unframed rows, rules, and open space.
- Do not use rounded cards below 8px for major media.
- Do not introduce a second typeface. The portfolio is Helvetica-only; the
  display/body/mono split described in Cohere's own system does not apply here.
- Do not render undocumented interaction variants in documentation or previews.
- Do not use saturated gradients as normal UI backgrounds; keep gradients media-led.

## Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---:|---|
| Small Mobile | <425px | Single-column cards, compact nav, reduced hero headline scale |
| Mobile | 425-640px | Hero media stacks, card grids become one column, form rows stack |
| Large Mobile | 640-768px | Wider one-column layouts with larger media cards |
| Tablet | 768-1024px | Two-column cards begin, nav spacing tightens |
| Desktop | 1024-1440px | Full nav, 3-column card grids, split hero compositions |
| Large Desktop | 1440-2560px | Wide containers and large empty vertical intervals |

### Touch Targets

Primary CTAs and pills meet comfortable touch sizing through 12px-24px padding and pill radii. Research filter chips and blog category chips are larger than standard tags, making dense taxonomy surfaces usable on touch devices.

### Collapsing Strategy

- Nav collapses from full horizontal links to a compact mobile menu.
- Hero media moves from split cards to stacked cards.
- Product and capability grids collapse from 3 columns to 2 and then 1.
- Form fields collapse from paired rows to a single column.
- Research rows preserve their rule-separated structure but stack metadata below titles on smaller widths.

## Iteration Guide

1. Start from a white canvas or a full-width dark green/navy band; avoid mid-tone page backgrounds unless the screenshot shows a specific CTA/form section.
2. Use `button-primary` for the single highest-priority action and `button-secondary` for the companion action.
3. Use `hero-photo-card` or `agent-console-card` when a page needs visual energy; avoid invented dashboard data.
4. For editorial pages, combine `blog-filter-chip`, `button-pill-outline`, and `research-table` instead of generic marketing cards.
5. Keep component examples structurally honest: placeholder product frames are better than invented product content.

## Known Gaps

- Exact proprietary font files are not bundled; use the documented fallbacks when implementing externally.
- Mobile screenshots were not regenerated in this public update, so mobile behavior is documented from the desktop system and existing responsive patterns.
- Some live pages lazy-load content blocks late; blank testimonial placeholders are documented as placeholder skeleton surfaces rather than filled testimonial cards.
